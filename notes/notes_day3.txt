Lifecycle of class component:
1. creation:
	a. constructor: 
	gets executed only one time, that is during creation of component instance
	ONLY state and other property initialization or binding methods to the current context should be done here
	NO setState() call should be made here
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE
	
	b. getDerivedStateFromProps(newProps, newState) (static): gets executed everytime including the first time. it should eother return null or return new state object.[rarest of rare]
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE
	
	c. render: 
	gets executed first time and subsequently on every state update
	Job is to produce VDOM related react elements
	NO setState() call should be made here DIRECTLY
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE

	d. componentDidMount:
	gets executed first time and ONLY one time during the lifecycle of component
	Prefect place to write SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE
	Note: if you set state here then Render will be invoked ONE MORE TIME as part of creation stage

2. update stage:
	a. getDerivedStateFromProps(newProps, newState)

	b. shouldComponentUpdate(newProps,newState):[rare]
	this function gets executed everytime after the first time upon re-rendering of the parent component. should return true/false which wil decide whether any further events shoudl be fired or not.
        it receives the new props object directly and the component's props will updated after this function execution is over considering the component has received new property values
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE

	c. render

	d. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(oldProps, oldState):[rare]
	this function gets executed everytime after the first time upon re-rendering of the parent component. should return value (known as snapshot) or null. the return value is passed to componentDidUpdate event method.
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE

	e. componentDidUpdate(oldProps,oldState,snpashot):
	this function gets executed everytime after the first time upon re-rendering of the parent component
	Prefect place to write SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE
	Note: if you set state here then Render will be invoked again


primitive types: number, boolean,....
newProps.personId === this.props.personId
newProps.person === this.props.person

3. desctruction/unmounting stage:
	a. componentWillUnmount:
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE
	relase any resource here, such as subscription

4. error stage:
	a. static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
	b. componentDidCatch(error, info)
