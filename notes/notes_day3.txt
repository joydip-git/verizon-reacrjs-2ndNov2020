Lifecycle of class component:
1. creation:
	a. constructor: 
	gets executed only one time, that is during creation of component instance
	ONLY state and other property initialization or binding methods to the current context should be done here
	NO setState() call should be made here
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE
	
	b.
	
	c. render: 
	gets executed first time and subsequently on every state update
	Job is to produce VDOM related react elements
	NO setState() call should be made here DIRECTLY
	NO SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE HERE

	d. componentDidMount:
	gets executed first time and ONLY one time during the lifecycle of component
	Prefect place to write SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE
	Note: if you set state here then Render will be invoked ONE MORE TIME as part of creation stage

2. update stage:
	a. 
	b. 
	c. render
	d. 
	e. componentDidUpdate:
	this function gets executed everytime after the first time upon re-rendering of the paremt component
	Prefect place to write SIDE-EFFECT CAUSING CODE
	Note: if you set state here then Render will be invoked again
